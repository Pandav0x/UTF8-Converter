# Utf-8 converter

This program aim to convert files within a folder (and its sub folders) in UTF-8.
It can be from any encoding prior to the execution of the program. However, the only encoding tested are mainly ANSI and ISO 8859-1.
Further tests must be done.

## Use

You must compile the program prior to any use. I used Mingw-w64 as compiler as it have some unique libraries that I used as includes.
